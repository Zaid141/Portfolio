Our mission is to raise awareness of the on-going situations affeccting nature and at the same time make short films to engage the community to bring and spread the idea of sustainability. We also reach our audience to encourage them into donating towards a global cause. Currently, the website is focusing on the present flood situation in Pakistan and wants to create awareness and a platform for people to donate. The theme of the website is nature, hence there are short films related to nature and latest news and global problems. I wanted to create a simple yet informative website which would have a big purpose and would bring something to the community. Nature Reels believes that together we can change the world! </div> <h4 class="design">Design and Implementation</h4> <div> I had a very simple design in my mind from my wire frame which I had to evolve to make it a bit more detailed and informative. I added three pages: home, about and contact each having a purpose of its own. I created 3 html files, 3 css files and 2 java script files. The home section of the website was the first one to be implemented to give the website a face. This section starts with a short film regarding a nature debate as a means of information and entertainment. It further goes to tell the latest news regarding nature and images of the scenario. The images change upon clicking the next button which was implemented with java script. This section also has a facts section to house facts regarding the scenario. I then implemented the about section which was done creatively. I used to css to display text over the person's image when hovered upon the picture and blur it when doing so. This saved space and added an element of fun and interactivity for the user. The contact section was implemented next, it housed a contact form and a map of my location. The contact form when submitted, gives an alert of submission which was done with java script. </div> <h4 class="link"> Link to the Webapge </h4> <div><a href=" https://zaid141.github.io/Nature_Reels/plants.html">  https://zaid141.github.io/Nature_Reels/plants.html </a></div>`,

Our purpose was to create a comic to engage the community and to make comics interactive, hence more fun to read. The overall theme of the website is set in space as the idea behind the comic is time travel, therefore space acts as a medium for time travel. The story is about a scientist who is experimenting her latest creation: a teleportation portal. The portal drives her into different dimensions, in which she discovers new people, cultures and places. Her experiment is a success, and she can explore the world on a whole new level. </div> <h4 class="design">Design and Implementation</h4> <div> The website has a retro theme to give it sort of a game kind of look. As soon as you press “PRESS START TO PLAY”, the comic starts with a space themed music track. Clicking on the next button takes you through a portal GIF and the reader enters a new dimension. There are two buttons to move back and forth with each panel; these buttons also have a red, retro theme to go with the on-going retro, space theme. I coded for the most part to make the cover page for the website with a space themed music track. I positioned the panels and the buttons to in cooperate them into the website. The buttons were added with a hover effect, to indicate when they are pressed. I participated into the comic itself to gather the idea as a group and make the comic as interactive and fun as possible in the period we were allocated. I helped in the making of the Naruto panel as I had ample knowledge on the anime. The idea overall was so engaging for the group as we could make any dimension we wanted to, hence in cooperating everyone’s interests.
